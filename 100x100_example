 (55, 54): 'The most common and most useful metallic element, being of almost '

           'turgite, etc.). It is reduced on an enormous scale in three '
           'principal forms; viz., cast iron, steel, and wrought iron. Iron '
           'usually appears dark brown, from oxidation or impurity, but when '
           'pure, or an fresh surface, is a gray or white metal. It is easily '
           'oxidized (rusted) by moisture, and is attacked by many corrosive '
           'agents. Symbol Fe (Latin Ferrum). Atomic weight 55.9. Specific '
           'gravity, pure iron, 7.86; cast iron, 7.1. In magnetic properties, '
           'it is superior to all other substances. Note: The value of iron is '
           'largely due to the facility with which it can be worked. Thus, '
           'when heated it is malleable and ductile, and can be easily welded '
           'and forged at a high temperature. As cast iron, it is easily '
           'fusible; as steel, is very tough, and (when tempered) very hard '
           'and elastic. Chemically, iron is grouped with cobalt and nickel. '
           'Steel is a variety of iron containing more carbon than wrought '
           'iron, but less that cast iron. It is made either from wrought '
           'iron, by roasting in a packing of carbon (cementation) or from '
           'cast iron, by burning off the impurities in a Bessemer converter '
           '(then called Bessemer steel), or directly from the iron ore (as in '
           'the Siemens rotatory and generating furnace).',

           'seasons of continued rain, as in easterly storms, and is the '
           'proper rain cloud. The name is sometimes used to denote a raining '
           'cumulus, or cumulostratus. (e) Cirro-cumulus. This form consists, '
           'like the cirrus, of thin, broken, fleecelice clouds, but the parts '
           'are more or less rounded and regulary grouped. It is popularly '
           'called mackerel sky. (f) Cirro-stratus. In this form the patches '
